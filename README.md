# Puru Tuladhar - Personal Website

Welcome to repository that takes care of my personal website! 

This site is designed to showcase my work and interests, and it is powered by Cloudflare Pages.

This website utilizes GitHub integration for automatic deployment. Every time I commit changes to the main branch of my GitHub repository, Cloudflare Pages automatically builds and deploys the updated site. This seamless integration allows for efficient updates and management of my personal website.

- Automatic Deployments: Changes are reflected on the live site immediately after pushing to the main branch.
- Fast Performance: Hosted on Cloudflareâ€™s edge network, ensuring quick loading times for visitors.

For more details on how to set up a similar deployment process, you can refer to the [Cloudflare Git integration guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/)
